# PopulaireCoreGL

PopulaireCoreGL is a simulated BIOS environment written in Java using OpenGL (LWJGL 2.x). It aims to provide a realistic BIOS/UEFI-like interface. The project is cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS) and supports booting external OS JARs, disk management, and BIOS configuration.

---

## Features
- **BIOS/UEFI Simulation**: Realistic graphical BIOS interface with multiple tabs (Information, Boot, Advanced, Updates, Exit)
- **Boot Order Management**: Detects disks and allows users to configure boot order
- **External OS Booting**: Boots external Java-based OS JARs from `/cd` or `/disks` folders
- **Update System**: Built-in updater for downloading and applying new versions
- **Hardware Detection**: Detects some GPU bugs (e.g., Intel Xe driver issues)
- **Configurable RAM and Fast Boot**: Adjust RAM allocation and enable/disable fast boot
- **Custom Fonts**: Uses bundled VGA/FreeMono fonts for retro look
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS (Java 8+ required)

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Java 8 or higher (JDK recommended)
- [LWJGL 2.9.3](https://legacy.lwjgl.org/) (included via Gradle)
- Windows: Native DLLs are provided in `libs/` and `src/main/resources/natives/windows64/`

### Build Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```powershell
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd PopulaireCoreGL
   ```
2. **Build the project**
   ```powershell
   ./gradlew build
   ```
   The output JAR will be in `build/libs/`.

3. **Run the application**
   ```powershell
   java -jar build/libs/PopulaireCoreGL-<version>.jar
   ```

## Running PopulaireCoreGL in Production

For end users, running PopulaireCoreGL is simple and does not require building from source. Follow these steps:

### 1. Download the Latest Release
- Go to the GitHub Releases page of PopulaireCoreGL.
- Download the latest `PopulaireCoreGL-<version>.jar` from the published packages.
- Place the JAR file in a dedicated folder (e.g., `PopulaireCoreGL/`).

### 2. First Launch Behavior
- On the first launch, PopulaireCoreGL will automatically:
  - Extract required native libraries (DLLs/SOs) into the same folder as the JAR.
  - Create the folders `cd/` and `disks/` in the same directory for external OS and disk management.

### 3. How to Run

#### On Windows
- **Double-click** the JAR file (if Java is installed and associated with `.jar` files), or
- Use a batch script. Example `run.bat`:
  ```bat
  @echo off
  java -jar PopulaireCoreGL-<version>.jar
  pause
  ```
  Save this as `run.bat` in the same folder and double-click to launch.

#### On Linux/macOS
- Use a shell script. Example `run.sh`:
  ```sh
  #!/bin/sh
  java -jar PopulaireCoreGL-<version>.jar
  read -p "Press enter to exit"
  ```
  Make it executable:
  ```sh
  chmod +x run.sh
  ./run.sh
  ```

---

## Usage
- On launch, you have 5 seconds to press `F2` or `DELETE` to enter the BIOS, or `F12` for the boot menu.
- Configure boot order, RAM, and other settings in the BIOS interface.
- To boot an external OS, place a compatible JAR in `/cd` or `/disks`.
- Use the update tab to check for and apply updates.
